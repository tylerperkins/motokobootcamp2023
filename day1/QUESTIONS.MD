# Questions

## 1. How much is the current memory capacity of a canister?

4 GB

## 2. What is the issue with the following code sample?
```
actor {
  let counter : Nat = 0;
  //^  Change "let" to "var".
  public func increment_counter() : async () {
    counter := counter + 1;
  };
}
```

Let variables are immutable, so cannot be incremented.

## 3. What is the issue with the following code sample?

```
actor {
  var message : Text = 0;

  public query func change_message(new_message : Text) : async () {
         //^  Remove "query"
    message := new_message;
    return;
  };

  public query func see_message() : async Text {
    return(message);
  };
}
```

Functions that mutate an actor's state must not have the `query` attribute.


## 4.  False or True: we can remove the keyword **async** for return argument of a query function since queries are faster to answer.

False. Actors return *futures*, so the return value must be `async`.
